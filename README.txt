This is the work produced during the 13 weeks (+ project) of the course 02561 Computer Graphics at DTU. 

Note that the code could be nicer and definitely faster, but the libraries used in the course were subpar and time was limited.

Also see WireframeShader repo, which contains the project made at the end of this course.
